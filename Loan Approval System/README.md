Absolutely! Here's your **updated and polished `README.md`** for the Loan Approval System, incorporating all the latest progress including model selection and Streamlit integration:

---

# 🏦 Loan Approval System

The **Loan Approval System** is a machine learning-based project that predicts whether a loan application should be approved or rejected based on applicant data. The system is designed to assist financial institutions in making faster and more data-driven decisions.

---

## 📄 Project Overview

This project uses classification algorithms to analyze loan applicant data and determine the likelihood of loan approval. It automates the loan screening process, reducing manual effort and improving consistency.

---

## ✅ What the project covers?

### 1. Data Loading & Preprocessing

* Loaded dataset using **Pandas**
* Cleaned missing values using imputation
* Encoded categorical variables with `LabelEncoder` and `get_dummies` (where appropriate)
* Converted `'3+'` in dependents column to integer
* Selected 11 key features for modeling

### 2. Data Splitting

* Features (`X`) and target (`y`) separated
* Used `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection` to split data into training and testing sets

### 3. Model Building

Implemented and compared multiple ML models:

* **Logistic Regression**
* **Decision Tree Classifier**
* **Random Forest Classifier**
* **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** *(used in final Streamlit deployment)*

### 4. Model Evaluation

* Evaluated using:

  * Accuracy score
  * Confusion matrix
  * Classification report
* **Random Forest Classifier** performed best, but **SVC** was selected for deployment due to consistent performance and generalization

### 5. Predictive System

* Final model saved as `loan_model.pkl`
* Created a real-time prediction system using **Streamlit**
* Takes 11 user inputs (Gender, Income, Credit History, etc.)
* Predicts if the loan will be **Approved ✅** or **Rejected ❌**

---

## 💻 Streamlit Web App

A simple and interactive frontend is built using **Streamlit**.

### 🎮 How to Run:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### 🧾 Features:

* Collects user data via form inputs
* Internally transforms it to match the model input format
* Predicts instantly and shows result on screen

## 📊 Libraries Used

* `pandas`, `numpy` – for data manipulation
* `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – for visualization
* `sklearn` – for preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation
* `pickle` – for model serialization
* `streamlit` – for web-based UI
