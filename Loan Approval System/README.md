# üè¶ Loan Approval System

## üìÑ Project Overview

The **Loan Approval System** is a machine learning-based model that predicts whether a loan application should be approved or not based on various input features. The goal is to help financial institutions automate and streamline the loan approval process using data-driven insights.

## ‚úÖ What's Done So Far

### 1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**

* Loaded dataset using **Pandas**.
* Performed basic **data cleaning**:

  * Handled **missing values** using imputation.
  * Converted **categorical features** using **LabelEncoder** and **get\_dummies** (one-hot encoding).
  * Feature selection to retain only relevant columns for model training.

### 2. **Data Splitting**

* Split data into **features (X)** and **target (y)**.
* Used **train\_test\_split** from `sklearn.model_selection` to divide data into **training** and **testing** sets.

### 3. **Model Building**

* Implemented and trained multiple classifiers:

  * **Logistic Regression**
  * **Decision Tree Classifier**
  * **Random Forest Classifier**
* Evaluated models using:

  * **Accuracy score**
  * **Confusion matrix**
  * **Classification report**

### 4. **Model Evaluation**

* Compared the performance of all three models.
* Identified **Random Forest Classifier** as the best-performing model based on accuracy.

### 5. **Predictions**

* Generated predictions on test data.
* Model is ready to be used for future prediction tasks on new applications.

## üìä Libraries Used

* `pandas`, `numpy`
* `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
* `sklearn` (for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation)

## üöß Next Steps

* Improve model performance using **hyperparameter tuning** (GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV).
* Add **user interface** (e.g., Streamlit or Flask web app) for interactive predictions.
* Deploy the model via **API** or on a **cloud platform**.
* Add **explainability** using SHAP or LIME for better understanding of predictions.
