# 🧠 Parkinson's Disease Prediction System

This is a machine learning web application built using **Streamlit** to predict whether a person has Parkinson’s Disease based on biomedical voice measurements. It uses a trained model saved as `parkinson_model.pkl`.

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repository or Copy Files

Make sure all the files are in the same directory.

### 2. Install Dependencies

You can use pip to install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install streamlit scikit-learn pandas
```

### 3. Run the Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run parkinson_webpage.py
```

This will open the web app in your browser.

## 🧪 Inputs

The app accepts the following 22 biomedical voice measurements:

* MDVP\:Fo(Hz), MDVP\:Fhi(Hz), MDVP\:Flo(Hz)
* MDVP\:Jitter(%), MDVP\:Jitter(Abs), MDVP\:RAP
* MDVP\:PPQ, Jitter\:DDP, MDVP\:Shimmer
* MDVP\:Shimmer(dB), Shimmer\:APQ3, Shimmer\:APQ5
* MDVP\:APQ, Shimmer\:DDA, NHR, HNR
* RPDE, DFA, spread1, spread2, D2, PPE

These values can be collected from biomedical voice analysis.

## 🧠 Model

* Trained using **RandomForestClassifier** (or similar) in the notebook `Parkinson_disease_prediction_system.ipynb`.
* Saved using `pickle` as `parkinson_model.pkl`.
